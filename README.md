# Laptop Price Predictor
This project is a machine learning model that predicts laptop prices based on various specifications such as brand, screen size, RAM, storage type, GPU, and more. The model utilizes regression algorithms to provide accurate price estimates.

### Features
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Conducted in-depth analysis to understand data distribution, identify correlations, and visualize features that impact laptop prices.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handled missing values, cleaned data, and converted categorical variables into numerical format using techniques like one-hot encoding.
- **Feature Engineering:** Created new features such as pixels per inch (PPI) for improved model performance and eliminated multicollinearity.
- **Regression Models:** Implemented and evaluated multiple regression models, including Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.
- **Model Evaluation:** Assessed models using metrics like RÂ² and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) to ensure high prediction accuracy.

### Tools & Libraries
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook
